======DESCRIPTION============================================================
 Video attachment for “Object Manipulation and Position Control Using a Swarm With Global Inputs“ by Shiva Shahrokhi and Aaron T. Becker, at the University of Houston. 

Micro-robots are usually controlled by “global inputs”, where all robots receive the same control inputs. Video shows 4 challenges. First: to show that a swarm is different to one robot when we apply torque to an object. It then shows the kilobots experiments of applying torque to the object. Second: to show how the algorithm regulates the required orientation. Third: to show how it corrects and keeps the orientation. Fourth: It pushes the object to the required position with the desired orientation.
